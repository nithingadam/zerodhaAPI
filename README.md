Kite Connect Trading Automation
Overview
Kite Connect Trading Automation is a sophisticated, JavaScript-based application designed to streamline stock trading operations by integrating with Zerodha's Kite Connect API. This project empowers users to automate buy and sell transactions seamlessly through a robust server infrastructure, leveraging the power of the Kite Connect API and a custom-built Master Control Program (MCP) server. With advanced tooling and intuitive prompt-based interactions, the system enables precise execution of trading strategies, such as purchasing stocks like MRF with a single command.
This project is actively evolving, with ongoing enhancements to expand functionality and optimize performance, making it a versatile tool for traders and developers alike.
Features

Zerodha Kite Connect Integration: Securely connects to Zerodha's Kite platform using API credentials from a dedicated Personal App.
JavaScript Server: A high-performance server that orchestrates trading operations, ensuring reliable communication with the Kite Connect API.
MCP Server: A specialized Master Control Program server providing intuitive buy and sell functionalities for streamlined trade execution.
Prompt-Based Trading: Advanced integration with developer tools (e.g., Claude) to interpret user prompts, such as "buy a stock of MRF," and execute corresponding trades automatically.
Scalable Architecture: Designed with modularity in mind, allowing for future enhancements and seamless integration of new features.
Active Development: Continuous updates to introduce cutting-edge functionalities and improve system robustness.

Prerequisites
To set up and run this project, ensure you have the following:

Node.js: Version 14.x or higher for running the JavaScript server.
Zerodha Kite Connect Account: A registered account with Zerodha and a Personal App created on the Kite Connect Developer Console.
API Credentials: API key and secret from your Kite Connect Personal App.
Developer Tools: Access to Claude or similar tools for prompt-based trading (optional for manual operations).
Dependencies: Install required Node.js packages (listed in package.json).

Setup Instructions

Create a Personal App on Kite Connect:

Log in to the Kite Connect Developer Console.
Create a new Personal App and obtain the API key and secret.
Configure the app with appropriate redirect URLs and permissions.


Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/kite-connect-trading-automation.git
cd kite-connect-trading-automation


Install Dependencies:
npm install


Configure Environment Variables:

Create a .env file in the project root.
Add the following variables:KITE_API_KEY=your_api_key
KITE_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
KITE_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token


Generate the access token programmatically or via the Kite Connect authentication flow.


Run the JavaScript Server:
node server.js


Start the MCP Server:
node mcp-server.js


Optional: Integrate with Claude:

Update the developer tools in Claude to enable prompt-based trading.
Test the system by issuing commands like "buy a stock of MRF" to verify automatic trade execution.



Usage

Manual Trading:

Use the MCP server endpoints to trigger buy or sell orders programmatically.
Example API call to buy a stock:curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/buy -d '{"symbol": "MRF", "quantity": 1}'




Prompt-Based Trading:

Issue natural language commands through Claude (e.g., "buy a stock of MRF").
The system will detect the intent, invoke the appropriate tool, and execute the trade.


Monitoring:

Check server logs for real-time updates on trade executions and system status.
