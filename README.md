Kite Connect Trading Automation

 Overview

Kite Connect Trading Automation is a sophisticated, JavaScript-based application designed to streamline stock trading operations by integrating with Zerodha's Kite Connect API. This project empowers users to automate buy and sell transactions seamlessly through a robust server infrastructure, leveraging the power of the Kite Connect API and a custom-built Master Control Program (MCP) server. With advanced tooling and intuitive prompt-based interactions, the system enables precise execution of trading strategies, such as purchasing stocks like MRF with a single command.

This project is actively evolving, with ongoing enhancements to expand functionality and optimize performance, making it a versatile tool for traders and developers alike.

 Features

- Zerodha Kite Connect Integration: Securely connects to Zerodha's Kite platform using API credentials from a dedicated Personal App.
- JavaScript Server: A high-performance server that orchestrates trading operations, ensuring reliable communication with the Kite Connect API.
- MCP Server: A specialized Master Control Program server providing intuitive buy and sell functionalities for streamlined trade execution.
- Prompt-Based Trading: Advanced integration with developer tools (e.g., Claude) to interpret user prompts, such as "buy a stock of MRF," and execute corresponding trades automatically.
- Scalable Architecture: Designed with modularity in mind, allowing for future enhancements and seamless integration of new features.
- Active Development: Continuous updates to introduce cutting-edge functionalities and improve system robustness.

 Prerequisites

To set up and run this project, ensure you have the following:

- Node.js: Version 14.x or higher for running the JavaScript server.
- Zerodha Kite Connect Account: A registered account with Zerodha and a Personal App created on the Kite Connect Developer Console.
- API Credentials: API key and secret from your Kite Connect Personal App.
- Developer Tools: Access to Claude or similar tools for prompt-based trading (optional for manual operations).
- Dependencies: Install required Node.js packages (listed in `package.json`).

 Setup Instructions

1. Create a Personal App on Kite Connect:
   - Log in to the [Kite Connect Developer Console](https://developers.kite.trade/).
   - Create a new Personal App and obtain the API key and secret.
   - Configure the app with appropriate redirect URLs and permissions.

2. Clone the Repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nithingadam/zerodhaAPI.git
   cd zerodhaAPI
   ```

3. Install Dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Configure Environment Variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root.
   - Add the following variables:
     ```env
     KITE_API_KEY=your_api_key
     KITE_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
     KITE_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token
     ```
   - Generate the access token programmatically or via the Kite Connect authentication flow.

5. Run the JavaScript Server:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

6. Start the MCP Server:
   ```bash
   node mcp-server.js
   ```

7. Optional: Integrate with Claude:
   - Update the developer tools in Claude to enable prompt-based trading.
   - Test the system by issuing commands like "buy a stock of MRF" to verify automatic trade execution.

 Usage

- Manual Trading:
  - Use the MCP server endpoints to trigger buy or sell orders programmatically.
  - Example API call to buy a stock:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/buy -d '{"symbol": "MRF", "quantity": 1}'
    ```

- Prompt-Based Trading:
  - Issue natural language commands through Claude (e.g., "buy a stock of MRF").
  - The system will detect the intent, invoke the appropriate tool, and execute the trade.

- Monitoring:
  - Check server logs for real-time updates on trade executions and system status.
